Docker Architecture:
====================
Docker architecture divide into 3 parts, such as client, docker daemon and registry.
Client:
client is nothing but user, who is going to give the request like, docker build, docker pull,
docker start container, these kind of instruction we are going to give through client to the daemon.
API will take the request and sends the instruction to daemon.

Daemon:
Daemon will listen request from the API,then it will create images, containers, volumes, network, 
one daemon will communicate with other daemon also.

Host:
Host is nothing but where the docker engine is installed.

Registry:
Registry nothing but the repository where we are going to keep our images, containers in repository.
